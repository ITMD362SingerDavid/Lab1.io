        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is David Singer, I am a second-year ITM (Information of
          Technology and Management) Major at Illinois Institute of Technology.
          I am a member of the Men's Volleyball team and the Society of
          Automotive Engineers. I graduated from an IT Magnet school in FLorida.
          My life in the great Windy City of Chicago is amazing. The city is full
          of endless opportunity. Let's make change, together.
